Correct the export dialog so that there would be a props of feilds instead of default feilds, when some feilds are selected e.g department and their value are being inputed they should query the backend(fetchData(feildName)) to get the departments based on that value and then display a dropdown for the user to select a correct value making that feild more safe, they should all be controllable with props
